  # Git [Syncer]
  #
  #  This mirrors a remote git repository
  #
  # Notes about usage:
  #
  #  The backup must be performed on the server in which the final data is stored.
  #  In other words, this is not a PUSH-type backup, but a PULL one.
  #
  # Requirements:
  #
  #  git must be accessible from the command line.
  #  The account performing the backup must be able to access the remote repository.
