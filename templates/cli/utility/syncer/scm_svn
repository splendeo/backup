  # SVNSync [Syncer]
  #
  #  This mirrors a remote svn repository using svnsync ( http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/svnsync.txt  )
  #
  #  The backup repositories are created using svnadmin.
  #
  # Notes about usage:
  #
  #  As a result of how svsync works, the backup must be performed on the server in which the final backup is stored.
  #  In other words, this is not a PUSH-type backup, but a PULL one.
  #
  # Requirements:
  #
  #  svn must be accessible from the command line.
  #  The account performing the backup must be able to access the remote svn repository.
  #  The account performing the backup must be able to perform svnadmin locally.
